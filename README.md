Intelligent Convective Regulator: Smart Fan Physics Project

As part of my physics capstone, I led the end-to-end design and implementation of an intelligent smart fan system driven by fuzzy logic. This project dynamically regulates fan speed to ensure optimal thermal comfort, integrating temperature, humidity, and user urgency inputs via a real-time microcontroller (Arduino UNO-V1888) platform.

Key Features:

Advanced fuzzy logic controller for real-world, comfort-centric fan modulation

Integrated BME280 environmental sensor and interactive OLED/rotary encoder interface

PWM-based DC fan control with automatic humidity adaptation and urgent cooling options

Robust safety protections (overheat, stall, electrical surge)

Fully open-source implementation with documentation, code, and reproducible results

Achieved cost-effective prototyping (total bill of materials under ₹2,000)

Outcomes:

Outperformed simple thermostat and PID-based systems in responsiveness and user satisfaction

Provided a platform for further IoT, AI/ML, and smart home applications

Developed skills in embedded systems, control theory, electronics, and project management
